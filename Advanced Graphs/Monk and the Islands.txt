/**************
Monk and the Islands

Monk visits the land of Islands. There are a total of N islands numbered from 1 to N. Some pairs of islands are connected to each other by Bidirectional bridges running over water.
Monk hates to cross these bridges as they require a lot of efforts. He is standing at Island #1 and wants to reach the Island #N. Find the minimum the number of bridges that he shall have to cross, if he takes the optimal route.
Input format:
First line contains T. T testcases follow.
First line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, M.
Each of the next M lines contains two space-separated integers X and Y , denoting that there is a bridge between Island X and Island Y.
Output format:
Print the answer to each test case in a new line.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
1 ≤ M ≤ 100000
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ N
